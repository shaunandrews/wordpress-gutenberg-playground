# Because the number of jobs spawned can quickly balloon out of control, the following methodology is applied when
# building out the matrix below:
#
# - The two most recent releases of WordPress are tested against all PHP/MySQL LTS version combinations and the
#   most recent innovation release.
# - The next 6 oldest versions of WordPress are tested against both the oldest and newest releases of PHP currently
#   supported for both PHP 7 & 8 along with the oldest and newest MySQL LTS versions currently supported (no innovation
#   releases). At the current 3 releases per year pace, this accounts for 2 additional years worth of releases.
# - Of the remaining versions of WordPress still receiving security updates, only test the ones where the database
#   version was updated since the previous major release.
# - The oldest version of WordPress receiving security updates should always be tested against the same combinations as
#   detailed for the two most recent releases.

#  Notes about chosen MySQL versions:
#    - Only the most recent innovation release should be included in testing.
#    - Even though MySQL >= 5.5.5 is currently supported, there are no 5.5.x Docker containers available that work on
#      modern architectures.
#    - 5.6.x Docker containers are available and work, but 5.6 only accounts for ~2.3% of installs as of 12/6/2024.defaults:
#    - 5.7.x accounts for ~20% of installs, so this is used below instead.

  # Tests the full list of PHP/MySQL combinations for the two most recent versions of WordPress.
