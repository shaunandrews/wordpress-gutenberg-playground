# Migrating Blocks for iframe Editor Compatibility

## Overview

The iframe integration is part of an ongoing effort to modernize the editing experience. WordPress is moving toward running the post editor inside an iframe, building upon the original iframe migration in the template editor.

This guide encourages migration of blocks to API version 3 in preparation for the planned iframe integration of the post editor. It helps verify in advance that blocks work in the iframe editor and assists in updating blocks so they work correctly in the iframe environment.

## What is the iframe editor?

### Benefits of the iframe editor

From a technical perspective, the iframe editor provides several important benefits:

-   **Style isolation**: Admin styles no longer affect the editor content, eliminating the need to reset admin CSS rules. Content styles no longer affect the admin screen, so block and theme CSS rules no longer need to be prefixed.
-   **Viewport-relative units**: Viewport-relative CSS units (`vw`, `vh`) work correctly. The dimensions of the editor content are usually not the same as the dimensions of the admin page, so without an iframe, units like `vw` would be relative to the admin page.
-   **Media queries**: Media queries work natively without needing workarounds, which were fragile.
-   **Easier development**: Block and theme authors benefit because styles from the front-end can be dropped in with very little, if anything, to adjust. This also applies to lighter blocks, where the editor DOM structure matches the front-end.
-   **Selection handling**: With a separate window for the editor content, it's possible for the selection in the editor to remain visible while also having a (collapsed) selection in the editor UI, for example an input field for a URL.

The iframed post editor will make life easier for block and theme authors by reducing styling conflicts and improving layout accuracy.

### When does the post editor work as an iframe?

While most editors, including the template editor, already work as iframes, for backward compatibility, the current post editor only works as an iframe when the following conditions are met (determined by [the useShouldIframe hook](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/cd4fae71551e0ebf27472da1d7bbdfce91a131ec/packages/edit-post/src/components/layout/use-should-iframe.js#L16)):

- **If the Gutenberg plugin is enabled:**: The active theme is a block-based theme OR all registered blocks have `apiVersion` 3 or higher
- **If the Gutenberg plugin is not enabled:**: All registered blocks have `apiVersion` 3 or higher

In summary, if you haven't been able to fully test your blocks in the iframe editor yet, by maintaining `apiVersion` 2, you can prevent the post editor from working as an iframe in most cases. Once you've confirmed that your blocks work in the iframe editor, you can then migrate to `apiVersion` 3.

### When will the post editor work as an iframe?

**In WordPress 7.0, the post editor is planned to always work as an iframe, regardless of the `apiVersion` of registered blocks**.

Ahead of this, to encourage developers to test in the iframe editor, WordPress 6.9 introduces the following developer warnings and schema changes:

-   **Browser console warnings**: When `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is enabled and blocks are registered with `apiVersion` 2 or lower, WordPress displays the following message in the browser console:
  ```
  The block "my-plugin/my-block" is registered with API version 2 or lower. This means that the post editor may work as a non-iframe editor.
  Since all editors are planned to work as iframes in the future, set the `apiVersion` field to 3 and test the block inside the iframe editor.
  See: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/r
  ```
-   **block.json schema update**: The [block.json schema](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/schemas/json/block.json) has been updated to only allow `apiVersion: 3` for new or updated blocks. Older versions (`1` or `2`) will no longer pass schema validation.

## How to test your blocks in the iframe post editor

All core blocks are already using `apiVersion` 3, so simply changing your `apiVersion` to 3 should allow your blocks to work in the iframe post editor.

However, make sure that no other third-party blocks registered with version 2 or lower are present. If blocks with version 2 or lower are registered, the post editor may not work as an iframe editor.

## Technical considerations for the iframe editor

Most blocks should work in the iframe editor without modification, but the following technical considerations and things to be aware of are documented below.

### Document and window

The iframe will have a different `document` and `window` than the admin page, which is now the parent window. Editor scripts are loaded in the admin page, so accessing the `document` or `window` to do something with the content will no longer work.

Most blocks written in React should continue to work properly, except if you rely on `document` or `window`. To fix, you need to create a ref to access the relative document ([`ownerDocument`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/ownerDocument)) or window ([`defaultView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/defaultView)). Regardless of the iframe, it is good practice to do this and avoid the use of globals.

### Using useRef

```javascript
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
import { useRef, useEffect } from '@wordpress/element';

export default function Edit() {
	const ref = useRef();

	useEffect( () => {
		const { ownerDocument } = ref.current;
		const { defaultView } = ownerDocument;
		defaultView.addEventListener( ... );
		return () => {
			defaultView.removeEventListener( ... );
		};
	}, [] );

	const blockProps = useBlockProps( { ref } );

	return (
		<div { ...blockProps }>
			Hello world!
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Using useRefEffect (recommended)

If you attach event handlers, remember that the `useEffect` callback will not be called if the ref changes, so it is good practice to use the new `useRefEffect` API, which *will* call the given callback if the ref changes in addition to any dependencies passed.

```javascript
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
import { useRefEffect } from '@wordpress/element';

export default function Edit() {
	const ref = useRefEffect( ( element ) => {
		const { ownerDocument } = element;
		const { defaultView } = ownerDocument;
		defaultView.addEventListener( ... );
		return () => {
			defaultView.removeEventListener( ... );
		};
	}, [] );

	const blockProps = useBlockProps( { ref } );

	return (
		<div { ...blockProps }>
			Hello world!
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Other frameworks and libraries

For the editor, scripts such as jQuery are loaded in the parent window (admin page), which is fine. When using these to interact with a block in the iframe, you should pass the element reference.

```javascript
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
import { useRefEffect } from '@wordpress/element';
import jQuery from 'jquery';

export default function Edit() {
	const ref = useRefEffect( ( element ) => {
		jQuery( element ).masonry( … );
		return () => {
			jQuery( element ).masonry( 'destroy' );
		}
	}, [] );

	const blockProps = useBlockProps( { ref } );

	return (
		<div { ...blockProps }>
			Hello world!
		</div>
	);
}
```

### What if the library uses global window or document and it's out of your control?

Submit an issue or PR for the library to use `ownerDocument` and `defaultView` instead of the globals. Ideally, any library should allow initialization with an element in an iframe as the target. It's never impossible. Feel free to contact us to mention the issue.

In the meantime, you can use the script that is loaded inside the iframe. We've loaded all front-end scripts in the iframe to fix these cases, but note that ideally you shouldn't use scripts loaded in the iframe at all. You can use `defaultView` to access the script.

```javascript
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
import { useRefEffect } from '@wordpress/element';
import jQuery from 'jquery';

export default function Edit() {
	const ref = useRefEffect( ( element ) => {
		const { ownerDocument } = element;
		const { defaultView } = ownerDocument;

		// Use the script loaded in the iframe.
		// Scripts are loaded asynchronously, so check if the script is loaded.
		// After the dependencies have loaded, the block will re-render.
		if ( ! defaultView.jQuery ) {
			return;
		}

		defaultView.jQuery( element ).masonry( … );
		return () => {
			defaultView.jQuery( element ).masonry( 'destroy' );
		}
	} );

	const blockProps = useBlockProps( { ref } );

	return (
		<div { ...blockProps }>
			Hello world!
		</div>
	);
}
```
